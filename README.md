# Data-Pipeline-web-scraping
Build as large of a dataset as I can by web scraping.  Preprocess the examples by cleaning and formatting them.
Using Selenium


## What need to do
The main idea is that you'll use web scraping to collect data from the internet. You'll put this data together to create a dataset which you can use for future projects.

## Presentation

- A Github repo containing all of the code 
- The dataset
- A presentation explaining
  - the different locations on the internet that your script collects data from
the layout of a example webpages you scraped and how you targeted elements within them
in what format you chose to store your data and why
how you cleaned the data

## Deadline

The project deadline is for 2 weeks from when announced.

## Prize

- Special prize for the individual who collects the largest dataset.
- Can you figure out how to put the script on a remote server using AWS (or another cloud provider) so that it doesn't run on your local machine? Don't worry, all the cloud providers give free credits.
